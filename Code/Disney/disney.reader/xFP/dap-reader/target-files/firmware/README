This directory holds the following device firmware:

  1. Lumidigm Biometric Reader (xbio)

The files are used by the reader software to detect
and automatically upgrade those devices. In order for
the software to correctly determine if an upgrade is
necessary, the files must be named as following:

  1. For xbio reader: xbio-<version>.bin

The reader software will only consider the first match
as determined by the OS, so only one file per firmware
type should be present. In addition, the only criteria
the reader software uses to determine if an upgrade is
necessary is whether the current version matches the
file version. This means that the firmware can both be
upgraded and downgraded through this mechanism.
