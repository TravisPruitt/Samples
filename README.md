### Dev/ML Ops

####Google Cloud Hero

<https://youtu.be/KOfbWR-eaHI>

Conceived and implemented the Google Cloud Hero program as a Google partner. Program was run world-wide to help introduce engineers to new cloud concepts and best practices. As an experience that engineers would participate in, we would monitor each individual's progress, help them understand specific cloud technologies. As their partner, we would work directly with enterprises on their challenging scenarios, scale and cost issues, and up-lifting internal resources. Much of the emerging needs were in the machine learning and IoT space.
